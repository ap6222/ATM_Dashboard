### **Project Description: ATM Transaction Dashboard**

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive **ATM Transaction Dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to ATM transactions, maintenance costs, and revenue generation. The dashboard serves as a critical tool for financial analysts, ATM operators, and decision-makers to monitor and manage ATM operations more efficiently.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a real-time, interactive view of various metrics associated with ATM functionality, including transaction volumes, costs, revenues, and operational efficiency across different states and months. By utilizing data-driven insights, the dashboard helps optimize operational costs, identify revenue-generating opportunities, and assess performance trends over time.

### **Key Features of the ATM Transaction Dashboard:**

1. **Transaction and Revenue Insights**:
   - **Total Costs** and **Monthly Transaction Volumes** are displayed to provide a snapshot of the overall operational performance.
   - **Revenue Breakdown** across various categories, including **MHA Revenue**, **Monthly Revenue**, and **ATM Revenue Total**, provides detailed insights into revenue generation by ATM locations and services.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - The dashboard includes a detailed analysis of **ATM Maintenance Costs** (such as **ATM AMC**, **UPS AMC**, **VSAT AMC**, **Site Maintenance**, etc.) and **Spare Costs** associated with ATM servicing, which helps track and manage maintenance expenses efficiently.

3. **Financial Transactions Overview**:
   - Visualizations of **Financial Transactions (Fin Txn)** and **Non-Financial Transactions (Non-Fin Txn)** by month provide clarity on ATM usage patterns and help identify trends in customer behavior.

4. **State-wise Performance**:
   - **Revenue and Transaction Breakdown by State** is included, allowing users to compare performance across different regions, such as Assam, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, and others.

5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Up Time** and **Gross Profit** percentages are displayed to track ATM operational efficiency and profitability over time, with a focus on maintaining high uptime and cost-effective service.

6. **Trend Analysis**:
   - A **Monthly Revenue and Transaction Trend** chart provides insights into performance fluctuations over time, helping to predict future trends and set benchmarks for improvement.

### **Objective**

The objective of the ATM Transaction Dashboard project is to deliver a **data visualization tool** that provides stakeholders with actionable insights into ATM performance, transaction trends, and cost management. The dashboard aims to:
- Improve decision-making by offering a comprehensive view of key metrics.
- Help optimize operational costs by tracking maintenance expenditures.
- Identify opportunities for increasing revenue by analyzing transaction volumes and trends.
- Monitor the performance of ATMs across various states and ensure efficient operations.

The dashboard's interactive nature allows users to filter data, drill down into specific metrics, and easily assess the health of ATM operations, ultimately driving better financial and operational strategies.
